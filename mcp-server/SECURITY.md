# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the Gemini Research Agent MCP Server seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### 🚨 Please DO NOT Report Security Vulnerabilities Publicly

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report them responsibly by emailing us directly.

### 📧 How to Report

Send an email to: **security@project.com** (or create a private security advisory)

Include the following information:
- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could potentially do
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof-of-concept
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### 📋 What to Include

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Vulnerability Type**: e.g., injection, authentication bypass, etc.
2. **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
3. **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or data exposure
4. **Environment Details**: OS, Python version, dependencies
5. **Timeline**: Any constraints on disclosure timeline

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

We commit to:
- **Acknowledge** your report within **48 hours**
- **Provide** an initial assessment within **5 business days**
- **Keep you updated** on our progress toward resolution
- **Notify you** when the vulnerability is fixed

### 🏆 Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help us improve our security:
- We'll credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We'll include you in our hall of fame for responsible disclosure
- For significant vulnerabilities, we may offer a token of appreciation

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not supported   |

**Note**: We strongly recommend always using the latest stable version.

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔑 API Key Management
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for API key storage
- **Rotate API keys** regularly
- **Use separate API keys** for different environments
- **Monitor API key usage** for unusual activity

#### 🌐 Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communications
- **Validate SSL certificates** in production
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Monitor network traffic** for suspicious patterns

#### 🏗️ Deployment Security
- **Run with minimal privileges** (don't use root)
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Use virtual environments** to isolate dependencies
- **Monitor logs** for security events
- **Implement proper logging** without exposing sensitive data

#### 📋 Configuration Security
- **Review configuration files** for sensitive data
- **Use secure defaults** in production
- **Validate all inputs** from external sources
- **Sanitize outputs** to prevent information leakage

### For Developers

#### 🔒 Secure Coding Practices
- **Validate all inputs** at API boundaries
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent injection
- **Implement proper error handling** without information disclosure
- **Follow principle of least privilege** in code design
- **Use secure random number generation** where applicable

#### 🧪 Security Testing
- **Include security tests** in your test suite
- **Test error conditions** and edge cases
- **Validate input sanitization** thoroughly
- **Test authentication and authorization** mechanisms
- **Review dependencies** for known vulnerabilities

#### 📦 Dependency Management
- **Pin dependency versions** in requirements.txt
- **Regularly update dependencies** to patch vulnerabilities
- **Use dependency scanning tools** like `safety` or `bandit`
- **Review new dependencies** before adding them
- **Monitor security advisories** for used packages

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

#### ✅ Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Query parameters are properly escaped
- API responses are structured to prevent injection

#### ✅ Error Handling
- Errors don't expose sensitive system information
- Stack traces are logged but not returned to users
- Graceful degradation on failures

#### ✅ API Security
- API keys are handled securely through environment variables
- No API keys are logged or included in error messages
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse

#### ✅ Dependencies
- All dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface

### 🔍 Areas for Ongoing Attention

#### Network Communications
- All external API calls use HTTPS
- SSL certificate validation is enabled
- Connection timeouts are configured appropriately

#### Data Handling
- No persistent storage of sensitive research data
- Temporary data is properly cleaned up
- Citations and URLs are validated before use

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Structured logging without sensitive data exposure
- Appropriate log levels for different environments
- No API keys or personal data in logs

## 🔧 Security Tools and Automation

### Recommended Tools

#### For Development
```bash
# Install security scanning tools
pip install bandit safety

# Run security scans
bandit -r server.py
safety check
```

#### For Dependency Scanning
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check requirements.txt

# Audit Python packages
pip-audit
```

#### For Code Analysis
```bash
# Static analysis for security issues
bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json

# Check for secrets in code
git-secrets --scan
```

### CI/CD Security

We recommend implementing:
- **Automated security scanning** in CI pipelines
- **Dependency vulnerability checks** on every commit
- **Static code analysis** for security issues
- **Secret scanning** to prevent credential leaks
